        Tory Lanez, born Daystar Shemuel Shua Peterson on July 27, 1992, in Brampton, Canada, is a singer, rapper, and producer. Growing up in a musical family, he started rapping at 16 and gained early recognition with his 2013 mixtape Conflicts of My Soul. He signed with Mad Love/Interscope Records in 2015 and released popular albums including Chixtape 5 in 2019, which was certified gold.
        Tory is known for his versatility, blending rap and R&B, and for pioneering new music distribution methods like NFT albums. In 2022, his career was overshadowed by a legal case that resulted in a 10-year prison sentence for shooting fellow artist Megan Thee Stallion. Despite incarceration, he continues to create and release music.
